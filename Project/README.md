# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System using Deep Learning (MobileNetV2 + Streamlit)

---

## 📘 Overview

This project is an **AI-powered web application** that detects the presence of **brain tumors from MRI scans** using **Deep Learning** and **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**.  
The system is built with **TensorFlow** for training and **Streamlit** for deployment, providing an interactive, web-based user interface.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> To build a lightweight, accurate, and deployable deep learning model for brain tumor detection using **MobileNetV2** and deploy it as a **Streamlit web app** accessible globally.

---

## 🌍 Features

- 🧠 Detects tumors from MRI images with high accuracy  
- ⚡ Lightweight model (~15 MB)  
- 💻 Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux  
- ☁️ One-click deployable on Streamlit Cloud  
- 🎯 Achieves up to **97% accuracy**
